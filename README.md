# TomTom Adventures Flaming Special Archipelago
### What Now?
Yeah, you haven't heard of this game. That's because I made it myself in 2017 as one of the many game side projects I had throughout high school. It's not a great game by any means but I have fond memories of it and decided to use it as a way to get into APWorld developing. Please give it a try if you want a small and easy game to add to your list of playable AP games :)

### How do I install this?
Refer to the [setup guide](https://github.com/Awesome7285/TomTom4AP/blob/main/docs/setup_en.md) for instructions on installing and connecting to a multiworld.

### Plans for the future
- Deathlink
- Other power-ups randomized
- Roomsanity (every individual room is a check)
- Other fillers or potentially traps
- Poptracker?
